# TIC-TAC-TOE GAME USING REACT

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React. It provides a user-friendly interface for playing the game and demonstrates the basics of React components, state management, and event handling.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abckhush/tic-tac-toe-react.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-react
2. Installing the Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Running the Application:
   ```bash
   npm start

## How To Play
- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) in an empty square.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
